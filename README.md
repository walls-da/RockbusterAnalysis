# RockbusterAnalysis
Data analysis via SQL on a (fictional) movie service company aiming to transition to streaming 
## Project Overview
In this project, a relational database was created from Rockbuster's inventory, customer demographics, and inventory pricing via pgAdmin 4 software. With it, PostgreSql and Tableau were used to gather and visualize trends. The insights from this project helped device a launch strategy for a new online platform of movie streaming.  

## Questions
To help Rockbuster transition to a streaming service, this analysis investigates these 5 questions: 

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
